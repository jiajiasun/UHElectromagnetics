The objective of this lab exercise is to help students develop a better understanding of time-domain EM, with the help of the interactive apps that allow students to adjust model and survey parameters and simulate EM fields and fluxes. <br>\n\nAfter finishing this exercise, students will understand <br>\n* how the currents and magnetic field propagate in a homogeneous halfspace (Task 1 and 6); <br>\n* how the background conductivity affects the propagation of the currents (Task 2, 8 and 9); <br>\n* how the height and moment of the inductive source affect the strength of the EM signal (Task 3); <br>\n* how the currents and magnetic field propagate in a layered medium (Task 4, 5 and 7). <br>\n* how a near-surface conductive layer affect the detection of a deep conductive body (Task 10). <br>\n\nAuthor: Jiajia Sun at University of Houston, October 9nd, 2018."

The thicknesses of the top two layers are given by $h_1$ and $h_2$, respectively.\n\nFor the time domain EM experiment in this lab, a transient VMD (i.e., vertical magnetic dipole) source (*Tx*) is used to excite the Earth, and the Earth's TEM response (secondary magnetic field) is measured by a receiver (*Rx*). In practice, the transmitter and receiver may be placed near the Earth's surface or in the air. The receiver measures secondary fields at a variety of times after the source is shut off.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/geoscixyz/em_apps/blob/master/images/LayeredEarthTEM.png?raw=true\"></img>\n"
