Similar to the previous lab, we will make use of the interactive EM apps. <br>\n\nAfter finishing this exercise, you will understand <br>\n** for a frequency domain EM experiment**, \n* how resistivity of a subsurface target affects the phase lag; <br>\n* how resistivity of a subsurface target affects the amplitude of the induced current; <br>\n* how the in-phase and quadrature components are affected by resistivity; <br>\n* how the coupling between transmitter and receiver loops affects the induced current; <br>\n\n** and for a time domain EM experiment**, \n* how the resistivity affects the decay rate of the induced current; <br>\n* how the depth of the subsurface target affects the decaying behavior of the induced current; <br>\n* how the primary in the transmitter loop affects the decaying behavior of the induced current. <br>\n\nAuthor: Jiajia Sun at University of Houston, September 25th, 2018."
